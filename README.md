# Wind power park site planning and mapping

In the project work, we were to find a place where to build a Wind Power Park. 

Things that were considered:

•	Distance to buildings (residential, commercial, industrial)
•	Viewshed of the turbines
•	Distance to roads and railroads
•	Any nearby airports
•	Nature protection and other special use areas
•	Wind conditions
•	Elevation and slope

Things that were  not considered:

•	Land ownership
•	Agricultural fields (it’s okay to build on them)
•	Military radars (these are too difficult to model for our purpose)
•	Offshore Wind Power. Allowing this would make the assignment too simple. The site must be located on land.
