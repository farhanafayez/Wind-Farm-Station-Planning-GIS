# Wind power park site planning and mapping

In the project work, we were to find a place where to build a Wind Power Park. 

Things that were considered:

- Distance to buildings (residential, commercial, industrial)
- Viewshed of the turbines
- Distance to roads and railroads
- Nearby airports
- Nature conservation and other protected areas
- Parks and recreational areas
- Archeological sites
- Wind conditions
- Elevation and slope

Things that were  not considered:

- Land ownership
- Agricultural fields 
- Military radars 
- Offshore Wind Power
